**Depends on:** MultiMarkdown

This is a folk of [swaroopch's vim-markdown-preview](https://github.com/swaroopch/vim-markdown-preview).
It is working well on Windows now.

In Vim, (optionally) select some text and then press `:MarkdownPreview` and see the rendered results in a browser.

Useful when writing long-form text in Markdown but ultimately want to (1) send the rendered content in a rich email or (2) post to a blog in HTML format, etc.
